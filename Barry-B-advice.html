                <h4>Software Updates</h4>
                <p>Software update are not always your friend. As I have found out recently. The New Mac OSX update made some changes to the temianal app and wipped out all my previous settings. 
                    With that, always keep notes on youe passwords and your setting so you can reset up your applicaitons and documents.</p>
            
                <h4>Stay Calm.</h4>
                <p>You are learning a new launguage. It can be fristrating. But stay calm, an remember we are all in this togther. </P>

                    <h4>This is not a race</h4>
                <p>There is no prize for coming in first, second or third. Finishing faster than anyone else only menas you understood it better. This isn't a race. Slow down and take it all in.  </P>
